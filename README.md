# 1-Ramen-reviews-dataset

This is the 1st dataset I worked on after graduating from Lithan Academy. 
There's a very big difference between studying and actually working on the dataset on your own. Previously, there was step by step instruction (aka guidance) on how to work on each project. Now I had to think about what issue(s) I need to solve (i.e. came out a story for myself), and how to analyse the data (i.e. defining the analysis process), which was a very big challenge for me.
I learned a lot from this dataset using both Python and R. The dataset behaves differently when in Python and R, for example, categorical features will automically be in factor datatype, but not for Python. 
Let's hope my skills get better as the time goes.
